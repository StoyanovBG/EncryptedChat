# EncryptedChat
Project EncryptedChat:
Write a server/client pair of programs (‘echatsrv.c’ and ‘echatclnt.c’).  The server should mimic the behaviour of Process 1 from the previous task and the client - Process 2, respectively. The programs should use a FIFO (named pipe) as a communication method between them.
